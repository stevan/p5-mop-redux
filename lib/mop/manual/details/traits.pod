=head1 NAME

mop::manual::details::traits - A manual for p5-mop

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Traits are the preferred method of extension for the mop.
A trait is simply a subroutine which is in scope at the
time of class creation. The subroutine accepts as it's first
argument the meta-object it is being invoked upon, followed
by any remaining arguments that are passed.

Here is a simplistic example:

  class Foo is bar, baz(10, "gorch") {}

The MOP will transform this into the following:

  class Foo {}
  mop::traits::util::apply_trait(\&bar, mop::meta('Foo'));
  mop::traits::util::apply_trait(\&baz, mop::meta('Foo'), 10, "gorch");

The same transformation will occur when traits are applied
to attributes and methods.

=head1 BUGS

Since this module is still under development we would prefer to not
use the RT bug queue and instead use the built in issue tracker on
L<Github|http://www.github.com>.
